## Data

Currently we are using a mock database but we hope to improve this and use real data based on api's available online. this depends on our project timeline and how much we are able to implement. The current implementation is an exported array of Doctor interfaces, where each element represents a unique doctor. Any page can get a reference of the list and make filtered copies or find a unique element
